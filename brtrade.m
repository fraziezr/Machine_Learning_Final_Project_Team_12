% step 3: evaluation of performance
%
% using our third set of prices, we estimate dp at each time interval,
% if dp > t and current position <= 0 , we buy
% if dp < -t and current position >= 0, we sell
% else, do:nothing
%

% trade using the above algorithm. returns expected profit
%
% given a list of prices
% assumes k-means clustered patterns have already been calculated
% assumes parameters w_i have already been calculated
% position is 0 or 1 (we have nothing, we have a bitcoin)
% bank is the amount of cash we have
% threshold is the threshold for buying/selling
